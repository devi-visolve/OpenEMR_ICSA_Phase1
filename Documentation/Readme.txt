General Information
---------------------------------------

OSI Certified Open Source Software

---------------------------------------

OpenEMR is a modular, HIPAA compliant, Open Source, cross-platform Electronic Medical Records system (EMRS). It facilitates efficient office management through automated patient record journaling and billing integration, and has been successfully integrated with third-party technologies including speech recognition, secure wireless access, touch screen portables, and biometric authentication. Interface screens are customizable and optimized for consistency, simplicity, speed of access to patient information, and minimum eye strain. OpenEMR is based upon widely-used public standards to achieve maximum compatibility with evolving technologies. Adherence to these standards diversifies implementation possibilities through minimum hardware compatibility requirements.

Disclaimer:
PennFirm does not take any responsibility for incorrectly configured security systems, or operator negligence of the law. Office staff, physicians, and other members of the office management staff are responsible for the security of patient data. PennFirm is not responsible for the installation of this software in an insecure manner, or for patient data that is stolen. OpenEMR is provided as is, at the operator's own risk. When installing OpenEMR or any electronic medical records system, it is important to consult computer system security professionals and lawyers.

Technologies:
OpenEMR employs the following internet technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL

OpenEMR HIPAA-specific compliance features:
Time-based automatic logout with terminal inactivity
Physician authorization of staff-entered patient data
Group-based user categorization
Extensive logging of patient data changes
Patient-requested removal of personal data
Comprehensive patient file printable reporting

Pennington Firm has made reasonable attempts to provide OpenEMR in compliance with the United States Government's HIPAA regulations and mandates.  However, using OpenEMR does not guarentee HIPAA Compliance. HIPAA compliance requires changes in office practice patterns, and also that software such as OpenEMR be used responsibly by office support staff, physicians, office managers, etc. For example, most entry fields in OpenEMR save all previous values, for logging purposes. These values include Patient Demographic, Patient History, and Transaction information. When editing past Patient Encounter Forms, however, changes made to text boxes must be prepended or appended to the existing record, and electronically signed by the user with the user's initials or full name and date. This convention is used for forms because office staff may begin a form that is completed later by the physician - it is important in this case to see all of the changes to the data within the same window, and not only the most recent modifications. This usability and interface function, when used in this manner will provide comprehensive data history that is HIPAA compliant.

Conversion to an Electronic Medical Records System:
Conversion of an office to an EMR system is not immediate, but rather an ongoing process that may last anywhere from several months to years. Forms conversion in OpenEMR requires a limited knowledge of programming and database development, though it is highly advisable that a practice-appointed technical professional and system programmer help to make any conversion to an electronic medical records system.  Pennington Firm (PennFirm.com) offers these services available at www.PennFirm.com.  Many methods exist for gradually converting operations to an EMRS, but in the beginning, it is recommended that only new patients and frequent repeat patients be entered into the system.

Notice of Information Practices:
This HIPAA-required document details how a patient's personal health information will be used for treatment, billing, and all other purposes. It must outline a patient's rights to their personal data, including the ability to audit, inspect, amend, or  request a copy of their entire patient record.

Security:
The OpenEMR system is designed to run on a physically-protected computer with restricted access. Physical access to the computer should be logged in writing, and physician practice policies should reflect limited access privileges to office staff.
OpenEMR may be run on land-line or wireless networks. Wireless networks should run on encrypted 802.11b subsystems, or better.
The OpenEMR server system should be set up with firewall functionality, limiting database access only to PHP which should be run locally on the server. All ports except secure http should be blocked to outside IP addresses. Remote terminals that must access OpenEMR should be assigned static IP addresses, and only these IP addresses should be allowed to access the secure http port on the server machine.
OpenEMR should be accessed over an SSL connection.
OpenEMR user passwords should be changed at least once a month.
Additional security measures not listed here may be employed.

Brief HIPAA Overview:
HIPAA refers to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  HIPAA mandates that health-care providers take steps to ensure the privacy and security of patient information. It outlines a time-line for compliance, and steps that must be taken in handling protected patient information. HIPAA mandates compliance by April 14, 2003.
