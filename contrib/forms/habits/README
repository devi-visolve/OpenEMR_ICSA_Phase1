this form needs couple of functions that were added into /library/api.inc.
one is 
I am transcribing the paper forms to electronic, thus, the logic in these ones is not good yet


function dateToDB ($date) 
{
	$date=substr ($date,6,4)."-".substr ($date,3,2)."-".substr($date, 0,2);
	return $date;
}


and the opposite is


function DBToDate ($date)
{
	$date=substr ($date,5,2)."/".substr ($date,8,2)."/".substr($date, 0,4);
	return $date;
}



much more functionality can be added to proofread the date.
