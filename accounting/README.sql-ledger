                     Integrating SQL-Ledger with OpenEMR
                              by Tekkno Genius


1. Install sql-ledger according to sql-ledger's instructions. Make sure it is
working before adding the support for openemr. Installation basically amounts
to untarring sql-ledger in a directory, creating an alias/virtual directory in
your web server, creating the sql-ledger user in the postgresql database, see
the sql-ledger README for the details:

  http://www.sql-ledger.org/cgi-bin/nav.pl?page=source/readme.txt&title=README

OpenEMR configuration:

2. Create a sql-ledger user for openemr to post as. Bring up sql-ledger in
admin mode [http://localhost/sql-ledger/admin.pl]. Login as the sql-ledger
user. Create a dataset (database) for openemr to put its data (I called mine
openemr) and used the default set of books (accounting codes). Create a user
to use this dataset. I created a user called openemr. Note, this user is not a
postgresql user, it is a sql-ledger user. You see that you need to put a user
to log into postgresql as. Here I used the default sql-ledger user. Make sure
you select the Pg (postgresql) driver.

3.Edit the sql-ledger.conf file. Add the following to the default
sql-ledger.conf:

  $oemr_ar_acc
  $oemr_cash_acc
  $oemr_due_days
  $oemr_username
  $oemr_services_partnumber

to the use vars section at the top 

Add the following also:

# Some constants relevant to OpenEMR import.
#
$oemr_username = 'openemr'; # sql-ledger user to post as
$oemr_ar_acc = '1200';      # account number for accounts receivable
$oemr_cash_acc = '1060';    # account number for checking (copay deposits)

# In SQL-Ledger you must create a services item for medical services
# before you do any OpenEMR billing. Specify its "part number" here:
#
$oemr_services_partnumber = 'MS';

# This is the number of days added to the OpenEMR transaction date to 
# produce the invoice due date when there is insurance. This affects the 
# patient portion of the outstanding balance shown in the OpenEMR patient 
# summary, and of course SQL-Ledger's aging reports and statements. 
#
$oemr_due_days = 40;

Note: $oemr_username is the same user you created in step 2.

Also note: A sample sql-ledger.conf including the above parameters is
included, however it may be incomplete from the standpoint of the current
SQL-Ledger release.

4. Copy ws_server.pl to the sql-ledger directory if you are using SQL-Ledger
2.4.x.  If you are using 2.6.x then copy ws_server_26.pl to that directory
as ws_server.pl.  Alternatively you can create a suitable symbolic link in
that directory.  Then, examine the resulting ws_server.pl and change the
"use lib qw" statement as indicated.

5. Edit the openemr/interface/globals.php and put the right data for the
following variables:

$sl_dbname = 'openemr';    // sql-ledger database name
$sl_dbuser = 'sql-ledger'; // sql-ledger database login name
$sl_dbpass = 'secret';     // sql-ledger database login password

Note: $sl_user is a postgresql user
$sl_dbname is the dataset you created in step 2.
